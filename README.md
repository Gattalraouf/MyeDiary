# My e-Diary
My e_Diary is a small growing app that aims to be the perfect place where you record events, experiences and other personal things that interest you. 
Where you can write about whatever you like, free of outside judgment or criticism. 
It should be an extension of your mind: safe and free. 


In short My e-Diary is the place where you can be honest. 
Diary writing can be therapeutic, productive and creative. 
If you have ever wanted a place to vent, reflect and grow, My e-Diary is that place.
